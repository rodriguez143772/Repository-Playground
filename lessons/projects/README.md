# TypeScript Projects

Real-world projects to apply what you've learned! Each project is designed for a specific point in your learning journey.

## How Projects Work

- Projects are labeled by the **minimum lesson** required (e.g., `02-` means you need lessons 1-2)
- Each project has a **starter file** with TODO comments and tests
- Complete the TODOs, then run the file to check your work
- Projects get progressively more complex as you advance

## Running Projects

```bash
bun lessons/projects/<project-file>.ts
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the requirements carefully** before coding
2. **Start simple** - get basic functionality working first
3. **Run tests often** to catch issues early
4. **Refactor** once tests pass - make your code cleaner
5. **Experiment** - add your own features after completing requirements!
